The due date for the weekly blog for {{ student_username }} ({{ student_email }}) with {{ suborg_name }} has passed and they have not made a blog post as of the due date on {{ due_date }}.<br />
<br />
It looks like they have {{ current_blog_count }} blog post(s) pending. Make sure to get your student to post as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
<b>Blogging is required for Python Software Foundation students, since that's how the org admin teams ensure that students are still active.  Inactive students will be given failing grades.<br /></b>
